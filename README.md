# Google-search-Suggestions-API-Interface-in-Python
I have used google search suggestions API to get maximum number of search suggestions per keyword.


Download the project.<br>
Install python 3x on your system.<br>
create a text file named as "input.txt"<br>
place in the same directory where "Google suggestions API.py" is.<br>
Copy and paste all the key words you want to get suggestions in input.txt (range 1-5000) <br>
Now run the python code  "Google suggestions API.py" <br>
